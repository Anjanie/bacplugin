How to use the BA Clothiers Shortcode Plugin and the BA Clothiers Widget.

	BA Clothiers Shortcode Plugin:
	
	This shortcode will allow you to control the number of recent posts that appear on a page of your choice. 
	This shortcode only allows the recent posts from the custom post type to appear on a page of your choice.
	This shortcode is made up of only two attributes: content_shortcode and posts_per_page. These attributes
	call on the shortcode function and allows you to set the number of recents posts to be viewed on the page.
	
	To use the shortcode and see these posts on a page, you must place this one line of code into the post text box on wordpress,
	found by adding a new page in the pages category. 
	
	*** SHORTCODE: [content_shortcode posts_per_page=5] *** (Just copy the shortcode from the first squared bracket to the last one.)
	
	By placing the shortcode exactly as seen above, in a page of your choice, you will be able
	to see the 5 most recent posts from the custom post type in which the title and the featured image will appear
	which can be clicked on. Once clicked on either the title or the image, it will redirect you to the actual post
	where you can read the content.
	
	This shortcode can be used in any page or post and will display the 5 most recent posts from the custom post type
	which will be listed with the name and the thumbnail. Both of these items are links which can be clicked on 
	that will redirect you directly to the post to read more. 
	
	The shortcode will automatially be working as long as the code from above is copied and placed into a post text box on
	WordPress. Update the post that is created with the shortcode and all you have to do is refresh the page and 
	the posts will appear in the main area of the webpage.
